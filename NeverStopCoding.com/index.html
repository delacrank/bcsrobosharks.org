    <!-- About the author -->    
    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    
        <p> My name is Juan Carlos, in 2014 I graduated with BA in Computer Information Systems. Currently I reside in Brooklyn and enjoy programming on my offtime.  My goal is to obtain an entry level position as a developer.  This website is a sample of some of the things I have learned through books and other sources online.
        
        <span class = "nl">I created this website on weekends as a learning guide for myself and others.  This site has many references from books I have read and below, I will cite many of the books and examples of code used from them.  I hope you can enjoy reading and learning from this site as much as I enjoyed writing it.</span>
        
        <span class = "nl">Hopefully if you are just starting out or if you are continuing your education, this will serve as motivation to move forward with your goals, reguardless of how daunting or time consuming they may be : )</span></p>

    <!-- How to navigate the site -->
    <h2>How to navigate the site</h2>
    
        <p>If you haven't noticed, this is a pretty large website containing over 300 pages.  There is a menu bar on the left column which contains links to the various sections, for those who are more experienced or need a quick reference point skip ahead to the section you need.  Alternatively, you can simply go through each section clicking next on the bottom of the page.</p>

    <h2>2017-10-08 02:01 Update:</h2>
    
        <p>Site was probably down for close to 2-3 weeks. I have a new hosting provider, so I should be good for at least another 2 years. Changed the domain name back to a dot com.
    
        <span class = "nl">Login and Forums will be down until I create the database for this new provider, thinking of adding a feature where users can upload images and upload text to a profile.</span>
    
        <span class = "nl">Purchased another domain name for personal stuff where I will add content about myself: books, movies, music, games, anime, etc. Mainly, it's to practice graphic design which, is something I recently started learning.</span>
    
        <span class = "nl">About 3 quarters through learning adobe illustrator, purchased 'above the fold' and 'don't make me think'. Looking to add some graphics and create interesting layouts on my new site. Will inform when I am finished.</span></p>

    <h2>2017-08-14 02:01 Update:</h2>
    
        <p>A lot has been going on, I've been working really hard in order to learn how to build and upload this forum. I finally have it up and running on my main site, although I might have to add a captcha system for bots. Also, I probably want to add some function where users require email validation, before being able to register a new account.
    
        <span class = "nl">I have added the source code for building the fourm on the site under web dev, web applications.  It's a new section, I might also include code for building a shopping cart application in the future.</span>
    
        <span class = "nl">Looking forward to learning more about OOP and will consider learning a framework, possibly Laravel. Will also be improving my javascript and learning some photoshop/illustrator in order to create some graphics for this site.</span>

        <p>Created a login and registration page along with database and php scripts to access this database. Had to refactor the scripts to handle prepared statements in order to protect against SQL injections. Made the login/registration forms look nicer with some CSS.

        <span class = "nl">Currently reading 'PhP and MySQL Web Development' by Luke and Laura.
